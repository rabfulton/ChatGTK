# ChatGTK - OpenAI Chat Client

A GTK-based Linux desktop client for OpenAI's API, featuring voice input/output and a clean interface. This project was primarily generated through AI assistance (Claude, O1, O3-mini).

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rabfulton/ChatGTK
cd ChatGTK
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Or use your package manager to install the dependencies. The application when launched from the terminal will complain about which dependencies are missing.

## Usage
The application looks for an enviroment variable: $OPENAI_API_KEY

You can get API credits by signing up at [OpenAI's platform](https://platform.openai.com/signup). Credits can be purchased from your [OpenAI account page](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/overview). Credits are very cheap compared to a subscription to the ChatGTP application. You need to create an API key to use the application.

```bash
./chatgtk.sh
```
Alterantively You can run the install script to add a desktop entry and set up the environment variable.
```bash
./install.sh
```
